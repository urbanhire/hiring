# JavaScript Challenges

A collection of JavaScript coding challenges.

## Getting Started

The only dependencies in this repo are for running the tests, which are written
in Tape and Sinon.

Install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

Then, in each challenge folder, you can run the following to see the tests for
that challenge.

```
node <challenge>-test.js
```

## Solving Challenges

This repo is only a set of challenges, it does not include the answers to any of
the challenges.

If you implement a solution of your own, please **do not** post it publicly on
this repository. Opening an issue or a pull request with a solution spoils the
experience of the challenge for other developers who find this repository.
